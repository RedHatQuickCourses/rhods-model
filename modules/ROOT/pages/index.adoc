= Creating Machine Learning Models with Red Hat OpenShift AI
:navtitle: Home

Welcome to this quick course on the _Creating Machine Learning Models with Red Hat OpenShift AI_.
This course is the *third* in a series of *five* courses about Red Hat OpenShift AI:

1. https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhods-intro[Introduction to Red Hat OpenShift AI]
2. https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhods-admin[Red Hat OpenShift AI Administration]
3. Creating Machine Learning Models with Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (_This course_)
4. https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhods-deploy[Deploying Machine Learning Models with Red Hat OpenShift AI]
5. https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhods-pipelines[Automation using Data Science Pipelines]

NOTE: After you have completed all the courses in the learning path, you can attempt the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps/tree/main/7.hands-on-lab["Hit the RHOAI"] exercise, that tests your understanding of the concepts taught in all the courses.

== Authors

The PTL team acknowledges the valuable contributions of the following Red Hat associates:

* Satyajit Lele
* Jaime Ramirez Castillo
* Max Murakami
* Sara Banderby
* Ravi Srinivasan

== Classroom Environment for Red Hat Associates

Continue using the https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=Red+Hat+OpenShift+Container+Platform+4.13+Workshop&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fopenshift-cnv.ocp413-wksp-cnv.prod[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.13 Workshop] classroom that you provisioned in the _Red Hat OpenShift AI Administration_ course.

You are expected to complete the _Red Hat OpenShift AI Administration_ course, where you install and configure a basic RHOAI instance, and then continue with this course.

== Classroom Environment for Red Hat Partners

Red Hat partners should continue to use the Red Hat OpenShift AI cluster provisioned in the _Red Hat OpenShift AI Administration_ course, using the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console at https://console.redhat.com/openshift/overview.

You are expected to complete the _Red Hat OpenShift AI Administration_ course, where you install and configure a basic RHOAI instance, and then continue with this course.
