== A common machine learning workflow

Data Preparation: Collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing the data like removing outliers

Feature Engineering: Selecting or creating relevant features to represent the data. E.g binning income

Model Creation and Evaluation: Creating and choosing an appropriate model and evaluating its performance

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for improved performance. E.g No of trees in RF

Deployment and Monitoring: Deploying the model in a production environment and monitoring its performance over time
