= Load a model and improve its performance

This section covers how to load a PyTorch model that we created and saved and perform some Hyperparameter tunining in order to improve its performance.

Open the 'PyTorch' WorkBench and clone the following Github repository https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps.git

By using the file browser in JupyterLab, open the '3.create-model/pytorch-lab/notebooks' directory, open the '03-model-improvement.ipynb' notebook and follow the instructions.
